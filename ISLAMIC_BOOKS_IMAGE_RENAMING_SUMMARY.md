## Updates Made

1. **Renamed all Islamic book images** with descriptive names that clearly indicate the content of each book
2. **Updated the add-categories-and-products.ts script** to:
   - Use the new image paths
   - Include all 34 Islamic book products (increased from 5)
   - Update the categorization logic to properly identify Islamic books by additional keywords
   - Fix import paths to work correctly with the project structure

## Product Entries Created

The updated script now includes detailed product entries for all 34 Islamic books with:
- Descriptive names
- Detailed descriptions
- Appropriate pricing
- Correct image paths
- Featured status where appropriate

## How to Use

To add these products to your database, run:
```bash
node add-categories-and-products.ts
```

This will create the Islamic Books category and all 34 book products with their corresponding images.
