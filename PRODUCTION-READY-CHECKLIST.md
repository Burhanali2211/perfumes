## 🛠️ Production Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run dev                 # Start development server
npm run type-check          # Run TypeScript checks
npm run lint               # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix           # Fix ESLint issues
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build              # Production build with optimization
npm run build:analyze      # Build with bundle analysis
npm run preview            # Preview production build
```

### Database Setup
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor AFTER all setup scripts:
\ir PRODUCTION-SECURITY-FIX.sql
```

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### File Structure (Cleaned)
```
src/
├── components/           # Shared presentational components
├── contexts/            # React contexts for state management
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                 # Utilities, schemas, clients

├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/               # Pure utility functions
```

### Component Standards
- **Naming:** PascalCase components, no "Enhanced" prefixes
- **Props:** Typed with TypeScript interfaces
- **Exports:** Named exports for tree-shaking
- **Performance:** Memoized where beneficial
- **Accessibility:** ARIA labels, keyboard navigation

### Import Standards
```typescript
// ✅ Clean imports with aliases
import { Button } from '@/components/Common/Button';
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext';
import { designTokens } from '@/lib/design-tokens';

// ❌ No more deep relative imports
import { Button } from '../../../components/Common/Button';
```

## 🧪 Quality Assurance
