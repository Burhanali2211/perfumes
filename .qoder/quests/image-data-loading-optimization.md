# Image and Data Loading Optimization Design

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy to optimize image and data loading performance in the perfumes e-commerce application. The current implementation suffers from slow loading times for both images and data, which negatively impacts user experience and conversion rates. This design addresses the root causes and provides a systematic approach to resolve these performance issues.

## Current Performance Issues Analysis

Based on the codebase analysis, the following key issues contribute to slow loading times:

1. **Inefficient Image Loading**
   - Lack of proper image optimization (format, size, compression)
   - No progressive loading or lazy loading implementation
   - Missing responsive image handling
   - No CDN or caching strategy for images

2. **Suboptimal Data Fetching**
   - Inefficient caching mechanisms with short TTL values
   - Lack of background data synchronization
   - No prefetching or preloading strategies
   - Absence of data compression for API responses

3. **Network Resilience Issues**
   - Limited retry mechanisms for failed requests
   - No circuit breaker pattern implementation
   - Insufficient offline support
   - Lack of bandwidth-aware loading strategies

4. **Resource Management**
   - No request prioritization
   - Missing resource bundling and compression
   - Inefficient component rendering
   - Absence of memory management strategies

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Image Loading Optimization

#### a. Modern Image Formats
Implement automatic format selection based on browser support:
- AVIF for modern browsers (best compression)
- WebP as fallback (good compression)
- JPEG/PNG as final fallback

#### b. Responsive Images
- Generate multiple sizes of each image
- Use `srcset` and `sizes` attributes
- Implement device pixel ratio awareness

#### c. Progressive Loading
- Implement blur-up technique with low-quality placeholders
- Add skeleton loaders for image containers
- Use intersection observer for lazy loading

#### d. Caching Strategy
- Implement HTTP caching headers
- Use service workers for offline image caching
- Add cache-busting for updated images

### 2. Data Loading Optimization

#### a. Intelligent Caching
Enhance the existing caching system with:
- Longer TTL values for static data
- Stale-while-revalidate strategy for critical data
- Cache warming for frequently accessed resources
- Tag-based cache invalidation

#### b. Data Prefetching
- Implement predictive prefetching based on user behavior
- Preload next page data during idle time
- Cache essential data on app initialization

#### c. Request Optimization
- Bundle multiple requests into single API calls
- Implement request deduplication
- Add request prioritization (critical vs background)

#### d. Compression
- Enable GZIP/Brotli compression for API responses
- Implement data structure optimization
- Use pagination for large datasets

### 3. Network Resilience

#### a. Retry Mechanisms
- Exponential backoff for failed requests
- Configurable retry conditions
- Timeout handling for hanging requests

#### b. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Prevent cascading failures
- Automatic recovery after timeout
- Monitoring and metrics collection

#### c. Offline Support
- Queue requests when offline
- Sync when connection is restored
- Inform users about offline status

### 4. Resource Management

#### a. Request Prioritization
- Critical resources (product images, prices) loaded first
- Non-critical resources (reviews, related products) loaded later
- Cancel low-priority requests when higher priority ones arrive

#### b. Memory Management
- Implement memory leak detection
- Clean up event listeners properly
- Use weak references where appropriate
